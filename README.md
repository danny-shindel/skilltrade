## Project Description

- Project Requirements
    - Build a full-stack MERN web app from the ground up. App must use token-based authentication for user sign-up, login, and logout. App must navigate dynamically in response to user login and protect CUD functionality from anonymous user. The app must have full "CRUD" data operations. Application must be styled and deployed online through Heroku.
- Execution
    - My application is based on the idea of a skills and services bartering exchange. User’s can create an account on SkillTrade and post skills or services they would like to offer in exchange for other user’s skills or services. Users can search for skills or services they want and send requests to the user owner of that skill or services offering their skill or service for barter. User’s have access to a “request inbox” where they can see requests they’ve accepted, pending requests from other users, and pending requests that they’s sent 

## Screenshots

> Home Screen: The 5 movies on the home screen are the top 5 saved movies by user of Kino Spisok. Hovering over the movie poster reveals how many "spiske" or lists, they are saved to. All movies IMDB page are linked in any view with the "IMDB" link.

> Commenting: Commenting is only available to users and only on the top 5 movie home screen. By clicking the "comment" button, the input and comments drop down. Users can delete their own comments, but hovering over their avatar and clicking the red "x" for that comment. You can also add movies you don't already have saved, from the top 5.

> Watch List: Movies in your watch list are listed in alphabetical order by director. They provide a link to move that movie to your "seen" list, that movie's IMDB page link, and a delete link.

> Seen Link: Your "seen" list movies are delineated by their blue outline. Hovering over a "seen" movie's poster shows the rating a user gave it. That rating can be updated by just clicking on the desired star rating. The "unsee" link will move a movie back into a user's watch list.

## Planned Future Enhancements
``05.13.21``

- User Wish-List Functionality
    - Allow users to create a "wish-list" of skills or services they wish to barter for upon sign-up that will allow the app to match them with user's who want to learn the skill or services they have to offer.
- Skill and Service Photos
    - Allow users to upload photos with their skill and service posts to better present the things they have to offer.
- Request Messaging
    - Upon acceptance of a request, users will be able to communicate through an in-app messaging service. They can work out the detail of their barter and exchange information when they'd like.
- Full Mobile Compatibility
    - In its current state the app is able to be used on a mobile browser, however, the interface is not fully adjusted for mobile browser use.
